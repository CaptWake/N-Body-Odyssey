SCPD Project 2024
Here's some text you can include in your project's README file regarding coding conventions and Clang-Formatter:

## Coding Conventions:

This project follows the Google C++ Style Guide for consistent code formatting and naming conventions.
A copy of the guide can be found here: [https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/cppguide.html](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/cppguide.html)

**Clang-Format:**

We use Clang-Format to automatically enforce consistent code formatting according to the Google C++ Style Guide.
* You can use the included script `format.sh` to format your code automatically:

```bash
./format.sh
```
